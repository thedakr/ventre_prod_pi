## Quick Start (For Team Members)

### 1. Review Core Documents
- Read `docs/team-roles-comprehensive.md` (start here!)
- Review agent specs in `docs/agent-specs/`
- Understand target demographic considerations (Part 4 of team roles doc)

### 2. Set Up Development Environment
(Instructions to be added as development begins)

### 3. Align on MVP Scope
- Which 2-3 agents for first cohort?
- What does the web portal MVP include?
- What is the 4-week curriculum structure?

---

## Success Metrics

### Traditional Metrics
- Number of businesses created
- Revenue generated by businesses
- Jobs created by businesses

### Expanded Metrics (recognizing diverse outcomes)
- Participants who gain better employment/pay
- Participants who increase income (even without business)
- Participants who develop entrepreneurial skills
- Participants who build professional networks
- Participants who report increased confidence
- Participants who access additional resources

**Why expanded metrics?** Not everyone will become a business owner, and that's okay. Skills, confidence, networks, and employment advancement are all valuable outcomes.

## Core Principles

1. **Fast Iteration:** Learn quickly through real-world testing, iterate based on feedback
2. **Accessibility First:** Design for low digital literacy, limited resources, mobile devices
3. **Human + AI:** AI augments human facilitation, doesn't replace it (initially)
4. **Participant-Centered:** Build for real needs of underserved populations, not assumptions
5. **Practical Over Perfect:** Ship MVP, learn, improve (Lean Startup approach)

---
