## 📈 SUCCESS INDICATORS (Qualitative)

Instead of checking boxes, assess confidence:

**After This Week:**
- Can we articulate what the methodology is about? (even roughly)
- Do we know which 20-30 materials to prioritize?
- Do we have experts scheduled and enthusiastic?
- Do we have realistic sense of extraction velocity?
- Does the team feel oriented and clear on next steps?

**If "yes" to most, Phase 1 is progressing well!**

- 🔴 Blocker identified (Slack/email immediately)
- 🟡 Task completed (update dashboard, mention in weekly)
- 🟢 Milestone reached (announce to team, celebrate!)

### Weekly Check-in Topics:
1. What's done?
2. What's in progress?

---

## 💡 TIPS FOR SUSTAINABLE PACE

### Do:
- ✅ Work in focused blocks (2-3 hours, then break)
- ✅ Time yourself (velocity data is valuable)
- ✅ Celebrate small wins (completed first material!)
- ✅ Ask for help when stuck
- ✅ Take weekends off (this is a marathon, not a sprint)

### Don't:
- ❌ Work 12-hour days (unsustainable)
- ❌ Skip tracking (you'll lose velocity data)
- ❌ Rush analysis for speed (quality matters)
- ❌ Batch updates (update dashboard as you go)
- ❌ Hide blockers (speak up early!)

## 🎯 CURRENT PHASE REMINDER

**Phase 1: Foundation**

**What we're doing:** Getting oriented, establishing velocity, building initial understanding

**What we're NOT doing:**
- Analyzing all 500+ materials (just Tier 1)
- Creating final framework (just provisional)
- Building agents yet (that's Phase 4)
- Rushing to launch (we launch when ready)

**Mindset:** Learn, adapt, set up for success in future phases

**Last Updated:** 2025-11-03
**Next Update Due:** [After first week of work]
**Dashboard Owner:** PM (coordinates updates)

## Quick Start: First Action This Week

**If you're reading this and wondering "What do I do right now?"**

👉 **Start here:** Materials triage (4-8 hours)
- Use `docs/templates/materials-triage.md`
- Methodology & Cohort Facilitator leads, PM supports
- Output: Know which 20-30 docs to analyze first

**Once triage is done, everything else gets easier.**
