# Decision Summary: 7 Critical Questions Answered

**Date:** 2025-11-04
**Status:** Foundation decisions locked, ready to proceed

---

## Overview

PM has resolved the 7 critical decisions needed to move forward with Vibe Entrepreneurship. This document summarizes those decisions and identifies remaining questions to address during Phase 1.

---

## ✅ RESOLVED DECISIONS

### 1. Agent Selection for MVP
**Decision:** Proceed with 3-agent MVP
- Chief of Staff (orchestrator)
- Market Discovery (customer validation)
- Methodology Coach (framework teaching)

**Rationale:**
- Focus on highest-risk early-stage validation phase
- Chief of Staff provides guidance for beginners
- Market Discovery prevents #1 failure mode (building what nobody wants)
- Methodology Coach builds entrepreneurial thinking capacity
- Product/Tech, Finance, and Strategy agents deferred to later cohorts

**PM Question Addressed:** "Why do we think the 3 targeted agents really are the best?"
**Answer:** See detailed rationale in EXECUTIVE-SUMMARY.md "Why These 3 Agents?" section

---

### 2. Community Partner
**Decision:** No partner yet identified

**Action Required:**
- PM to prioritize finding community partner
- Reach out to 2-3 organizations within next 2 weeks
- Partner essential for recruitment, trust-building, access to target demographic

**Implications:**
- Partner relationship blocks pilot cohort recruitment
- Should not delay Phase 1 (methodology extraction can proceed in parallel)
- May influence cohort timeline (depends on partner availability)

---

### 3. Cohort Format
**Decision:** Virtual cohort

**Implementation:**
- Zoom sessions for facilitated group meetings
- Web portal for AI agent access
- Technology access required (AI-based program)
- PM may provide laptops/AI subscriptions for participants who need them

**Rationale:**
- Aligns with AI agent delivery model (requires internet)
- Accessibility for distributed participants
- Lower logistical overhead than in-person

---

### 4. Development Timeline
**Decision:** 4-week development timeline accepted

**Action Required:**
- PM to confirm feasibility with AI Engineer this week
- Validate engineer capacity for scope

**Risk Mitigation:**
- Single portal approach (MVP-SINGLE-PORTAL-APPROACH.md) significantly reduces dev scope
- Chief of Staff orchestration pattern reduces from 3-6 separate chat interfaces to 1
- Estimated 3-4 weeks (vs original 6-8 weeks) with simplified architecture

---

### 5. Facilitation Model
**Decision:** Co-facilitation by Education Specialist + PM

**Exploration:**
- Considering whether AI Chief of Staff can partially facilitate
- Testing in early cohorts to see if human facilitation can be reduced over time
- Long-term vision: AI-facilitated at scale with minimal human intervention

**Rationale:**
- Two facilitators provide coverage and complementary strengths
- PM brings product/strategic lens, Education Specialist brings curriculum/pedagogy
- Co-facilitation model aligns with PM taking on agent development (40% in Phases 3-4)

---

### 6. Funding Model
**Decision:** Free for all participants

**Implementation:**
- No participant fees
- PM may provide laptops or AI subscriptions if needed for access
- Grant funding pathway to pursue AFTER learning from initial cohorts

**Rationale:**
- Aligns with underserved population focus (≤150% poverty line)
- Removes financial barrier to participation
- Sustainability planning deferred until post-pilot learnings validate model

**Note:** Budget implications to be determined (laptop costs, LLM API costs, facilitation time)

---

### 7. Post-Cohort Support
**Decision:** Ongoing access + cohort progression model

**Implementation:**
- Participants continue to access AI agents after cohort ends (duration TBD based on resources)
- Potential progression to further cohorts at different stages of business development
  - Example: Cohort 1 = Ideation/Validation, Cohort 2 = Building/Launching, Cohort 3 = Growth/Scale
- Long-term vision: Self-support at scale (AI agents enable ongoing support without facilitation)

**Rationale:**
- Entrepreneurship is a journey, not a 4-week event
- Ongoing access provides continued value and learning
- Staged cohorts allow participants to progress as their business evolves
- AI agents make ongoing support economically viable (vs human coaching)

## 🟡 ADDITIONAL DECISIONS TO ADDRESS

**Note:** These are important but can be resolved during Phase 1 (Foundation). See EXECUTIVE-SUMMARY.md for details.

### 8. Phase 1 Start Date
**Status:** Not yet determined
**Owner:** PM + Education Specialist
**Action:** Confirm team availability and set start date this week

### 9. Team Member Identification
**Status:** Unknown if Education Specialist and AI Engineer roles are filled
**Owner:** PM
**Action:** Confirm team roster, onboard to project structure if already hired

### 10. Technology Stack
**Status:** Engineer to decide specific technologies
**Owner:** AI Engineer (with PM input on vendor/cost)
**Timing:** Week 1-2 of development phase

### 11. Success Metrics for Phase 1
**Status:** Defined in WORKFLOW-ROADMAP.md, needs PM validation
**Owner:** PM + Education Specialist
**Action:** Review gate criteria, confirm readiness indicators

### 12. Pilot Cohort Timeline
**Status:** Estimate 3-6 months from Phase 1 start (velocity-dependent)
**Owner:** PM
**Action:** Project timeline after Phase 1 triage establishes extraction velocity

### 13. Data Privacy & Consent
**Status:** Not yet addressed
**Owner:** PM (can contract legal help)
**Action:** Draft privacy policy and informed consent before recruitment
**Timing:** Before pilot cohort recruitment begins (Phase 4)

### 14. Technology Access Support Logistics
**Status:** Not yet determined
**Owner:** PM
**Action:** Plan for laptop/subscription provision (how many, purchase vs loan, support)
**Timing:** Before cohort recruitment (affects budget and participant communications)

## 📋 IMMEDIATE NEXT STEPS

Based on resolved decisions, here's what can proceed immediately:

### This Week (Priority Actions):

1. **Confirm team roster** (Decision #9)
   - Are Education Specialist and AI Engineer identified?
   - Onboard them to repository and documentation

2. **Set Phase 1 start date** (Decision #8)
   - Coordinate with Education Specialist availability
   - Begin materials triage (4-8 hours)

3. **Initiate community partner outreach** (Decision #2)

## 📊 DECISION CONFIDENCE LEVEL

**High Confidence (Ready to Execute):**
- Agent selection (3 agents is right scope)
- Cohort format (virtual)
- Funding model (free for participants)
- Facilitation model (co-facilitation)

**Medium Confidence (Validate During Phase 1):**
- Development timeline (4 weeks - need engineer confirmation)
- Post-cohort support details (duration, cohort progression specifics)

**Low Confidence (Learn and Iterate):**
- Community partner relationship (don't know who yet)
- Technology access logistics (depends on participant needs)
- Pilot cohort timeline (depends on extraction velocity)

**Approach:** Proceed with high-confidence decisions, validate medium-confidence during Phase 1, iterate on low-confidence as you learn.

## 💬 PM QUESTION: "Did I Miss Anything?"

**Answer:** Your 7 decisions cover the critical path to proceed!

**Additional decisions identified above (#8-14) are important but not blockers.** You can address them during Phase 1 as the team begins work.

**One potential gap to consider:**
- **Hypothesis validation plan:** How will you test your 3 core hypotheses during the pilot cohort?
  1. Latent entrepreneurs exist in poor populations
  2. The methodology is uniquely suited for underserved populations
  3. AI can transform entrepreneurship practice for this demographic

**Recommendation:** Design pilot cohort to explicitly test these hypotheses (measurement framework, data collection, success metrics). This is covered somewhat in team-roles-comprehensive.md but could be more explicit.

---

## 🚀 YOU'RE READY TO START

**Bottom line:**
- Critical decisions: ✅ Done
- Project foundation: ✅ Built (git repo, documentation, templates)
- Team roles: ✅ Defined (including PM co-leading agent development)
- Workflow approach: ✅ Established (phase-based, velocity-driven)
- Architecture approach: ✅ Simplified (single portal with Chief of Staff orchestration)

**Next milestone:** Phase 1 Foundation begins (materials triage + expert scheduling)

**Estimated timeline to pilot cohort:** 3-6 months (will refine after Phase 1 velocity established)

**You have everything you need to kick off Phase 1 this week!**
