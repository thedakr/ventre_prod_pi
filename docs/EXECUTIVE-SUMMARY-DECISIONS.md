## Critical Decisions - RESOLVED ✅

**Date Decided:** 2025-11-05

### 1. Agent Selection for MVP ✅
**Decision:** Proceed with 6-agent MVP (5 Tier 1 individual agents + 1 Tier 2 cohort agent)

**Agents:**
- **Tier 1 (Individual):** Chief of Staff, Market Discovery, Methodology Coach, Business/Revenue Model, Route-to-Market, Strategic Conviction
- **Tier 2 (Cohort):** Cohort Facilitator

**Rationale:**
- 100% participant coverage across small business (63%), tech (30%), and social cause (29%)
- Stage-agnostic design (works across idea → validation → building → testing)
- Addresses universal questions (customers, pricing, acquisition, pivot decisions)
- Comprehensive but focused scope for MVP validation

**See:** `docs/MVP-AGENT-PRIORITY-LIST.md` and `docs/analysis/cohort-1-agent-selection.md` for detailed analysis

---

### 2. Community Partner ✅
**Decision:** No partner yet identified - Product Manager/PI to prioritize finding one

**Action Required:** Reach out to 2-3 community organizations within 2 weeks

**Why Critical:**
- Essential for recruitment (trusted local presence)
- Trust-building with Rising Talent demographic
- Access to target demographic (≤150% federal poverty line)
- Vetting for baseline digital literacy reduces tech support burden

**Status:** Immediate priority for Product Manager/PI (Matt Paxman)

---

### 3. Cohort Format ✅
**Decision:** Virtual cohort (technology access required for AI-based program)

**Implementation:**
- Zoom group sessions (2x/week, 90 minutes each)
- Web portal access for AI agents
- Potential laptop/subscription provision for participants without access

**Rationale:**
- AI-centered program requires internet and device access
- Geographic flexibility enables serving wider demographic
- Lower overhead than in-person (no venue costs)
- Enables transcript integration for Cohort Facilitator Agent

---

### 4. AI Engineer Capacity ✅
**Decision:** 10-12 week development timeline accepted (Product Manager/PI confirmed feasibility with engineer)

**Implementation:** Single portal approach (see `MVP-SINGLE-PORTAL-APPROACH.md`) reduces scope significantly

**Key Constraint:**
- Brendan Veranth at 50% capacity (20 hrs/week)
- Timeline flexible (sections can stretch 1.5-2x based on sprint velocity)
- Decision point at 6 weeks to assess mid-Jan vs. late-Jan launch

**Mitigation:**
- Aggressive scope control (6 agents, no feature creep)
- Track sprint velocity weekly
- Contractor backup if Brendan overloaded

---

### 5. Facilitation Lead ✅
**Decision:** Both Methodology & Cohort Facilitator (Agueda Schwartz) and Product Manager/PI (Matt Paxman) will co-facilitate

**Rationale:**
- Agueda brings entrepreneurship methodology expertise
- Matt brings product/systems thinking and SRE experience
- Co-facilitation provides coverage and diverse perspectives
- Both available across time zones (Eastern + Mountain)

**Future Consideration:** Exploring whether Cohort Facilitator Agent can assist with facilitation tasks (see Phase 3+ in `VISION-SCALING-STRATEGY.md`)

---

### 6. Funding Model ✅
**Decision:**
- **Free for all participants** (Cohort 1-3)
- Product Manager/PI may provide laptops/AI subscriptions if needed
- Grant funding pathway to pursue after learning from initial cohorts

**Timeline:** Sustainability planning deferred until post-pilot learnings

**Rationale:**
- Focus on validation, not monetization
- Removes financial barrier for Rising Talent demographic
- Learn first, optimize business model later
- Grant funding better suited after proof of concept

**See:** Phase 5 in `VISION-SCALING-STRATEGY.md` for long-term sustainability model (community org licensing)

---

### 7. Post-Cohort Support ✅
**Decision:**
- Ongoing access to AI agents (duration TBD based on resources)
- Potential progression to further cohorts at different business stages
- Long-term vision: Self-support at scale (minimal facilitation required)

**Rationale:**
- Entrepreneurial journey doesn't end after 8 weeks
- Continued agent access shows commitment to participants
- Alumni cohorts potential future offering (see Phase 8 in `VISION-SCALING-STRATEGY.md`)

**Constraint:** Duration depends on LLM API costs and team capacity

---

## Why These Decisions Matter

Each of these decisions shapes the MVP program's:
- **Scope** (6 agents, virtual, 8 weeks)
- **Feasibility** (timeline, team capacity)
- **Accessibility** (free, tech support, community partner)
- **Sustainability** (deferred until post-pilot)

**Key Principle:** Lock scope aggressively, validate hypotheses with Cohort 1, iterate based on learning.
