**AI Impact:** HIGH (framework teaching, pattern matching, adaptive learning)

**What it does:**
- Teaches Lean Startup, Business Model Canvas, Customer Development, Design Thinking, Jobs-to-be-Done
- Connects daily activities to broader methodologies ("What you're doing is Customer Discovery")
- 2-sentence explanations, expands on request (respects participant time)

### Priority 4: Business & Revenue Model
**Nickname:** "The Economic Engine Designer"
**Domain:** Business model design, revenue streams, unit economics, pricing

**Why Priority 4:**
- **Universal question:** "How do I make money?" - every participant asks this
- **Perfect for 63% small business:** Practical economics, not VC fundraising

**Coverage:** 100% participants (small business, tech, social cause), all stages

**Key differentiator:** JTBD pricing framework prevents common mistake of pricing based on costs/features instead of customer value

---

### Priority 5: Route-to-Market & Go-to-Market
**Nickname:** "The Market Access Strategist"
**Domain:** GTM strategy, channel selection, customer acquisition, distribution

- **Capital-efficient focus:** Tests channels systematically, optimizes CAC (good for underserved)
- **Action-oriented:** Designs acquisition experiments, tests marketing channels
- **Stage-appropriate:** Foundation (GTM strategy) → Launch (scale acquisition)

**AI Impact:** HIGH (channel optimization, CAC modeling, A/B testing, funnel analysis)

**What it does:**
- Designs go-to-market strategy
- Selects optimal distribution channels (tests Facebook vs. content vs. community)
- Models customer acquisition cost (CAC) and economics
- Optimizes marketing funnels and conversion
- Guides channel partnerships

**Coverage:** 100% participants (small business local marketing, tech digital marketing, social cause community outreach), all stages

**Key differentiator:** Focuses on capital-efficient acquisition (not "spend $50K on ads")

---

### Priority 6: Strategic Conviction Keeper
**Nickname:** "The Compass"
**Domain:** Tracking core beliefs vs. tactical experiments, pivot vs. persevere

**Why Priority 6:**
- **4-week intensity management:** Helps participants navigate cohort pressure and doubt
- **Prevents common mistakes:** Premature pivoting OR stubborn persistence
- **Peer dynamic support:** Manages comparison anxiety, conviction drift from group influence
- **Evidence-based decisions:** Separates signal from noise, strategic from tactical
- **Stage-agnostic:** Formation (exploring beliefs) → Response (pivot/persist decisions)

**AI Impact:** MEDIUM (pattern tracking, drift detection) - but strategic conviction deeply human

**What it does:**
- Distinguishes strategic convictions (persist) from tactical approaches (adapt)
- Tracks conviction evolution over time ("You keep returning to solopreneurs - that's a conviction")
- Guides pivot vs. persevere decisions with evidence
- Prevents strategic drift ("You say simple, but you're adding complexity")
- Manages pressure from cohort dynamics

**Coverage:** 100% participants, all stages

**Key differentiator:** Manages 4-week cohort pressure - prevents participants from giving up too soon or persisting too long

## Tier 2: Cohort Agent (1)

### Priority 7: Cohort Facilitator Agent

**Scope:** Knows ALL participants' projects, facilitates group dynamics

**Why essential:**
- **Two-tier architecture requirement:** Individual agents (Tier 1) + Cohort agent (Tier 2)
- **Session prep support:** Helps human facilitators prepare for 8 group sessions
- **Cross-participant synthesis:** "Sarah stuck on pricing, Jake validated customer, Maria needs GTM help"
- **Peer learning facilitation:** Identifies connections between participants who can help each other
- **Artifact aggregation:** Synthesizes weekly management reports across entire cohort

**AI Impact:** HIGH (synthesis across participants, pattern recognition, coordination)

- Identifies peer learning opportunities ("Jake solved pricing issue that Maria is facing - connect them")
- Synthesizes participant progress for group context
- Suggests discussion topics based on cohort needs
- Tracks cohort-level patterns and themes

**Coverage:** 100% of cohort dynamics, supports human facilitators

**Key differentiator:** Enables human facilitator to manage diverse stages/needs across 15 participants

## What We're NOT Building (Yet)

**Deferred to Cohort 2+:**
- Vision & Alignment - Important but not urgent for 4 weeks
- Business Archetype & Capital Strategy - Overlaps with Business/Revenue Model, premature for fundraising
- Founder & Team Readiness - Most participants solo, team-building premature
- Market Positioning - Can be covered by Market Discovery + Revenue Model
- Brand & Storytelling - Not urgent for validation cohort
- Ecosystem & Competitive - Can be covered by Market Discovery
- Legal, Risk & Compliance - Premature
- **Product & Technology - Only serves 30% tech, wrong audience for 63% small business**
- People, Culture & Leadership - Team-building, premature
- **Capital & Financing (CFO) - Fundraising premature, most bootstrapping**
- Operations & Systems - Process optimization, not urgent yet
- Customer Success & Retention - Need customers first
- Growth & Scaling - Need PMF first
- Innovation & Learning Adaptability - Later stage
- Founder Longevity & Resilience - Important but longer-term
- Impact & Sustainability - Can be addressed within other agents
- Exit & Legacy - Way premature
- Cognitive Loop Support - Can be integrated into Chief of Staff
- Execution Sequencer - Can be integrated into Chief of Staff
- Cross-Domain Integration - Can be integrated into Chief of Staff

**Total deferred:** 20 agents saved for future cohorts based on learning
