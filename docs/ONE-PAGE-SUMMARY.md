# Vibe Entrepreneurship: One-Page Summary

**Mission:** Enable would-be entrepreneurs below poverty line to start/run businesses with AI as mentor, partner, analyst, and employee.

**Target:** ≤150% US federal poverty line | **Timeline:** First cohort in 14-16 weeks | **Team:** 3.25 people

---

## What We're Building

**AI Agents** (6 for MVP) + **Proven Methodology** (from expert entrepreneurs) + **Cohort Facilitation** (human + AI) = Accessible entrepreneurship for underserved populations

**MVP Agents:** Chief of Staff, Market Discovery, Methodology Coach, Business/Revenue Model, Route-to-Market, Strategic Conviction

**Delivery:** 4-week cohort, 10-15 participants, virtual sessions, web portal for 24/7 agent access

---

## Three Core Hypotheses

1. **Latent entrepreneurs exist** in poor populations (AI + methodology will surface them)
2. **This methodology is uniquely suited** for underserved populations (optimized for low-resource contexts)
3. **AI can transform** entrepreneurship practice (removes barriers: knowledge, network, expertise)

---

## Critical Insight: Methodology MUST Come First

**Problem:** Can't implement effective agents without first codifying the methodology individuals will engage with.

**Solution:** 3-week methodology extraction (Weeks 1-3) feeds agent development (Weeks 4-8), with proper testing time before launch.

---

## 14-16 Week Development Plan

| Weeks | Methodology Track | Agent Development | Outcome |
|------|-------------------|-------------------|---------|
| **1-3** | Materials analysis + Expert Sessions 1-3 + Framework draft | Prototype architecture + Orchestration | Foundation & Planning |
| **4-8** | Agent specs + Validation | Implement 6 agents + Portal build | Build & Convergence |
| **9-12** | Support testing + Refinement | Refine agents + Fidelity testing | Test & Iterate |
| **13-16** | Support facilitation | Support participants | **Cohort 1 Launch!** |

---

## This Week's Priorities (Week 1)

### Priority 1: Materials Inventory (4-6 hrs, Product Manager/PI + Methodology & Cohort Facilitator + LXD)
Catalog all methodology materials, prioritize for extraction

### Priority 2: Schedule Expert Sessions (30 min, Product Manager/PI)
Book 3 x 90-min sessions with methodology creators over next 3 weeks

### Priority 3: Analyze Top 3 Materials (10-12 hrs, Methodology & Cohort Facilitator)
Extract frameworks, principles, language from facilitator guides/docs

### Priority 4: Prepare Expert Session 1 (2-3 hrs, Methodology & Cohort Facilitator)
Draft agenda: methodology overview, validate material analysis, fill gaps

---

## Critical Decisions Needed

1. **Agent MVP:** Confirm 6 agents (Chief of Staff, Market Discovery, Methodology Coach, Business/Revenue Model, Route-to-Market, Strategic Conviction)?
2. **Community Partner:** Who specifically? When to approach?
3. **AI Engineer Capacity:** 5 weeks (Weeks 4-8) realistic for 6 agents + portal?
4. **Cohort Format:** Virtual (recommended), in-person, or hybrid?
5. **Facilitation:** Methodology & Cohort Facilitator lead? Product Manager/PI supporting?
6. **Post-Cohort:** What ongoing support after 4 weeks?

---

## Team Roles (3.25 People)

**Matt Paxman (PM/PI):** Strategy, partnerships, operations, expert coordination (4-8 hrs/week Weeks 1-3, scaling up throughout)

**Agueda Schwartz (Methodology & Cohort Facilitator):** Methodology extraction (lead), curriculum design, facilitation (15-20 hrs/week Weeks 1-3, ongoing)

**Angela Lankford (LXD - 50%):** Materials analysis, methodology extraction support, documentation review (15-20 hrs/week Weeks 1-3, additional roles to be defined)

**Brendan Veranth (AI Engineer - 50%):** Agent implementation, web portal backend, technical infrastructure (ramping from 5% to 30% over Weeks 1-8)

**Matt Kitt (UI/UX/CX Product Advisor - 25%):** Portal design, accessibility, user testing, participant-facing materials (ramping based on portal development phase)

---

## Success Metrics

**Traditional:** Businesses created, revenue generated, jobs created

**Expanded:** Employment advancement, income increase, skill development, network building, confidence gains, resource access

*(Recognizing not everyone becomes business owner - and that's okay)*

## What Makes This Work

✅ **Fast iteration** (Build-Measure-Learn, fail fast, adapt quickly)

✅ **Methodology first** (Foundation before agents)

✅ **Underserved focus** (Plain language, mobile-first, low capital, confidence-building)

✅ **Human + AI** (Facilitator essential, AI augments 24/7)

✅ **Proven methodology** (Real engagements, expert-validated)

---

## Risks & Mitigations

🟢 **Professionally-paced timeline** → 14-16 weeks provides sustainable pace, built-in buffers, quality focus

🟡 **Community partner dependency** → Prioritize relationship, have backups

🟡 **Tech adoption challenges** → Human facilitation safety net, mobile-first, extensive onboarding
