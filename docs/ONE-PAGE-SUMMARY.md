# Vibe Entrepreneurship: One-Page Summary

**Mission:** Enable would-be entrepreneurs below poverty line to start/run businesses with AI as mentor, partner, analyst, and employee.

**Target:** ≤150% US federal poverty line | **Timeline:** First cohort in 8 weeks | **Team:** 2.5 people

---

## What We're Building

**AI Agents** (3 for MVP) + **Proven Methodology** (from expert entrepreneurs) + **Cohort Facilitation** (human + AI) = Accessible entrepreneurship for underserved populations

**MVP Agents:** Chief of Staff (coordinator), Market Discovery (customer research), Methodology Coach (framework teacher)

**Delivery:** 4-week cohort, 10-15 participants, virtual sessions, web portal for 24/7 agent access

---

## Three Core Hypotheses

1. **Latent entrepreneurs exist** in poor populations (AI + methodology will surface them)
2. **This methodology is uniquely suited** for underserved populations (optimized for low-resource contexts)
3. **AI can transform** entrepreneurship practice (removes barriers: knowledge, network, expertise)

---

## Critical Insight: Methodology MUST Come First

**Problem:** Can't implement effective agents without first codifying the methodology they'll teach.

**Solution:** 4-week methodology extraction (Weeks 1-4) feeds agent development (Weeks 3-6).

---

## 8-Week Sprint Plan

| Week | Methodology Track | Agent Development | Outcome |
|------|-------------------|-------------------|---------|
| **1-2** | Materials analysis + Expert Session 1 | Prototype architecture | Foundation |
| **3-4** | Expert Sessions 2-3 + Draft framework | Implement 3 agents | Convergence |
| **5-6** | Validate framework + Agent specs | Refine agents with methodology | Validation |
| **7-8** | Support facilitation | Support participants | **Launch!** |

---

## This Week's Priorities (Week 1)

### Priority 1: Materials Inventory (4-6 hrs, You + Edu Specialist)
Catalog all methodology materials, prioritize for extraction

### Priority 2: Schedule Expert Sessions (30 min, You)
Book 3 x 90-min sessions with methodology creators over next 3 weeks

### Priority 3: Analyze Top 3 Materials (10-12 hrs, Edu Specialist)
Extract frameworks, principles, language from facilitator guides/docs

### Priority 4: Prepare Expert Session 1 (2-3 hrs, Edu Specialist)
Draft agenda: methodology overview, validate material analysis, fill gaps

---

## Critical Decisions Needed

1. **Agent MVP:** Confirm 3 agents (Chief of Staff, Market Discovery, Methodology Coach)?
2. **Community Partner:** Who specifically? When to approach?
3. **AI Engineer Capacity:** 4 weeks realistic for 3 agents + portal?
4. **Cohort Format:** Virtual (recommended), in-person, or hybrid?
5. **Facilitation:** Education specialist lead? You supporting?
6. **Post-Cohort:** What ongoing support after 4 weeks?

---

## Team Roles (2.5 People)

**You (PM/PI):** Strategy, partnerships, operations, expert coordination (4-8 hrs/week Weeks 1-4)

**Education Specialist:** Methodology extraction (lead), curriculum design, facilitation (15-20 hrs/week Weeks 1-4)

**AI Engineer (50%):** Agent implementation, web portal, technical infrastructure (ramping from 5% to 30% over Weeks 1-6)

---

## Success Metrics

**Traditional:** Businesses created, revenue generated, jobs created

**Expanded:** Employment advancement, income increase, skill development, network building, confidence gains, resource access

*(Recognizing not everyone becomes business owner - and that's okay)*

## Key Documents

📍 **START HERE:** `docs/EXECUTIVE-SUMMARY.md` (decisions & recommendations)

⚡ **WEEK 1 ACTION:** `docs/QUICK-START-METHODOLOGY-EXTRACTION.md` (immediate steps)

📊 **VISUALIZE IT:** `docs/VISUAL-ROADMAP.md` (10 Mermaid diagrams)

📚 **DEEP DIVE:** `docs/team-roles-comprehensive.md` + `docs/methodology-extraction-plan.md`

🛠️ **TEMPLATES:** `docs/templates/` (materials inventory, extraction, expert sessions)

---

## What Makes This Work

✅ **Fast iteration** (Build-Measure-Learn, fail fast, adapt quickly)

✅ **Methodology first** (Foundation before agents)

✅ **Underserved focus** (Plain language, mobile-first, low capital, confidence-building)

✅ **Human + AI** (Facilitator essential, AI augments 24/7)

✅ **Proven methodology** (Real engagements, expert-validated)

---

## Risks & Mitigations

🔴 **Timeline aggressive** → Lock scope, no creep, Plan B (+2 weeks)

🟡 **Community partner dependency** → Prioritize relationship, have backups

🟡 **Tech adoption challenges** → Human facilitation safety net, mobile-first, extensive onboarding

---

## Next Team Meeting Agenda

1. Review this summary + Executive Summary (30 min)
2. Make 6 critical decisions (20 min)
3. Assign Week 1 tasks (10 min)
4. Schedule weekly syncs (5 min)
5. Questions & blockers (10 min)

---

## The Bottom Line

**You have:** Solid strategy, detailed roadmap, practical templates, 6 agent specs, expert partners

**You need:** Execute Week 1 (materials inventory, schedule experts, begin analysis), make decisions, maintain fast iteration mindset

**Timeline:** 8 weeks to first cohort | **MVP Scope:** 3 agents, 4-week cohort, 10-15 participants

**Critical path:** Methodology extraction (Weeks 1-4) → Agent implementation (Weeks 3-6) → Cohort launch (Weeks 7-8)
