## 🎯 Core Hypotheses Being Validated

Your initiative rests on three hypotheses:

### 1. Latent Entrepreneurs Exist in Poor Populations
- **Belief:** Entrepreneurial potential exists but is hidden/dormant
- **Validation approach:** Methodology extraction will reveal how experts surface this capability
- **Success indicator:** Participants discovering entrepreneurial capacity during cohorts

### 2. This Methodology is Uniquely Suited for Underserved
- **Belief:** The methodology is optimized for ≤150% poverty line participants
- **Validation approach:** Extract specific adaptations for low-resource/low-education contexts
- **Success indicator:** Higher success rates with underserved vs. traditional programs

### 3. AI Can Transform Entrepreneurship Practice
- **Belief:** AI removes barriers (knowledge, network, expertise access)
- **Validation approach:** Implement agents that provide 24/7 expert guidance
- **Success indicator:** Participants making progress with AI support between sessions

## 🚀 Immediate Next Steps (This Week)

### Priority 1: Materials Inventory (Day 1-2)
- [ ] **Action:** Catalog all methodology materials
- [ ] **Who:** You + Methodology & Cohort Facilitator
- [ ] **Time:** 4-6 hours
- [ ] **Template:** `docs/templates/materials-inventory.md`
- [ ] **Output:** Prioritized list of materials for extraction

### Priority 2: Schedule Expert Sessions (Day 1-2)
- [ ] **Action:** Contact methodology experts, book 3 sessions
- [ ] **Who:** You (PM)
- [ ] **Time:** 30 minutes
- [ ] **Sessions:**
  - Session 1: Methodology Overview & Validation (90 min)
  - Session 2: Decision-Making & Facilitation Wisdom (90 min)
  - Session 3: Underserved Population Adaptations (90 min)

### Priority 3: Begin Material Analysis (Day 3-5)
- [ ] **Action:** Analyze top 3 materials (facilitator guides, methodology docs)
- [ ] **Who:** Methodology & Cohort Facilitator
- [ ] **Time:** 10-12 hours
- [ ] **Template:** `docs/templates/material-extraction.md`
- [ ] **Output:** Extraction documents for each material

### Priority 4: Prepare Expert Session 1 (Day 4-5)
- [ ] **Action:** Customize Session 1 agenda based on material analysis

## 🎯 Critical Decisions Still Needed

### 1. Agent MVP Selection
**Question:** Agree on 3-agent start?
- **Recommendation:** Chief of Staff, Market Discovery, Methodology Coach
- **Alternative:** Add 4th agent (Capital/Finance or Product/Tech)?

### 2. Community Partner
**Question:** Who specifically? When to approach?
**Critical:** This relationship is essential for participant recruitment

### 3. AI Engineer Capacity
**Question:** Can 50% engineer deliver 3 agents + portal in 4 weeks?
**Consider:** May need to extend timeline, simplify portal, or contract help

### 4. Cohort Format
**Question:** Virtual, in-person, or hybrid?
**Recommendation:** Virtual initially (accessibility, distributed team)

### 5. Facilitation Lead
**Question:** Methodology & Cohort Facilitator primary? Product Manager/PI supporting?

### 6. Post-Cohort Support
**Question:** What happens after 4-week cohort?
- Ongoing agent access (how long?)
- Alumni community?
- Follow-on cohorts?

## ⚠️ Key Risks & Mitigations

### 🟢 LOW RISK: Professionally-Paced Timeline
**Strength:** 14-16 weeks to first cohort provides appropriate time for 3.25-person team
**Why this works:**
- Built-in buffers for quality work without burnout
- Sustainable pace maintains team effectiveness
- Time for proper testing and iteration
- Scope is clearly defined (6 agents, 4-week cohort, 10-15 participants)

### 🟡 MEDIUM RISK: Community Partner Dependency
**Risk:** Recruitment difficult without trusted partner
**Mitigation:**
- Prioritize this relationship immediately
- Have backup partners identified

### 🟡 MEDIUM RISK: Technology Adoption
**Risk:** Low digital literacy may mean struggles with agents
**Mitigation:**
- Human facilitation is safety net
- Mobile-first design
- Extensive onboarding support

## 🎯 The Critical Path

The **most important** sequence for next 16 weeks:

```
Weeks 1-3: Foundation & Planning
   Materials Inventory → Analyze Top Materials → Expert Sessions 1-3
   Draft Methodology Framework → Expert Validation
   ↓
Weeks 4-8: Build & Convergence
   Agent Implementation Specs → Implement 6 Agents + Portal
   Refine with Methodology
   ↓
Weeks 9-12: Test & Iterate
   Methodology Fidelity Testing → Expert Spot-Check
   Refine Prompts → Final Testing
   ↓
Weeks 13-16: Pilot Launch
   First Cohort Launched → Feedback Collection → Iteration Planning
```

**The foundation (methodology) must be solid before building the structure (agents).**

---

## 💡 Why Methodology Extraction Comes First

### Without Methodology Codified:
- ❌ Agents teach generic Lean Startup (available anywhere)
- ❌ Lose unique value of expert partners
- ❌ Miss adaptations for underserved populations
- ❌ Generic AI entrepreneurship assistants (not YOUR program)

### With Methodology Codified:
- ✅ Agents teach YOUR specific approach
- ✅ Framework optimized for poverty-line participants
- ✅ Unique differentiation from generic programs
- ✅ Evidence-based approach (proven with real participants)
- ✅ Foundation for long-term scaling

**This extraction work is prerequisite to effective agent implementation.**

## 📞 Questions for Discussion

To refine execution, we need clarity on:

### **About Materials:**
1. How many materials exist? (Rough estimate: 5? 50? 500?)
2. What format? (PDFs, videos, workbooks, mixed?)
3. Where are they? (Shared drive? Easy to access?)
4. Have you reviewed them yet?

### **About Experts:**
1. Can they do 3-4 x 90-min sessions over next 3 weeks?
2. Are they enthusiastic about being "knowledge extracted"?
3. Both in sessions together or separate?
4. Do they co-facilitate or have different roles?

### **About Team Capacity:**
1. Can Methodology & Cohort Facilitator dedicate 15-20 hrs/week for 3 weeks?
2. Can you dedicate 4-8 hrs/week for coordination?
3. Is 14-16 weeks realistic or should we adjust timeline?

### **About Scope:**
1. Extract full methodology or focus on Foundation phase only?
2. All 26 agent implementation specs or just MVP 6?
