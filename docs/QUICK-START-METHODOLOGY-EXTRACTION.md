# Quick Start: Methodology Extraction

**Goal:** Distill the entrepreneurship mastery framework from materials and experts within 3 weeks

**Why:** You can't implement effective AI agents without first codifying the methodology they'll teach.

---

## The Big Picture

You have **3 critical assets**:
1. Materials showing real executions of the methodology
2. Direct access to 2 expert entrepreneurs who created it
3. Agent specifications (but they need the methodology to work properly)

You need to **extract, synthesize, and codify** the methodology into a framework that:
- Defines the phases, frameworks, and principles
- Captures adaptations for underserved populations
- Guides AI agent implementation
- Serves as the foundation for your program

## Critical Success Factors

### 1. Methodology & Cohort Facilitator is the Lead
**Why:** Pedagogy expertise, understands learning design
**Time required:** 40-50% for Weeks 1-3 (15-20 hours/week)
**If not feasible:** Adjust timeline or bring in support

### 2. Materials Analysis Must Happen First
**Why:** You need context before expert sessions
**Don't skip:** Even quick analysis is better than none
**Temptation:** "Let's just ask experts everything" → You'll waste their time and miss details

### 3. Synthesize Expert Sessions Immediately
**Why:** Memory fades fast, insights are clearer when fresh
**Rule:** Within 24 hours of each session
**Tip:** Record sessions (with permission) for reference

### 4. Focus on What's Unique
**Why:** Generic startup advice is everywhere
**Dig for:** What makes THIS methodology different
**Especially:** Adaptations for underserved populations

### 5. Parallel Track with Agent Development
**Why:** Efficient use of team time across 14-16 week timeline
**Approach:**
- Weeks 1-3: Methodology extraction (this document's focus)
- Weeks 4-8: AI Engineer implements 6 agents + portal with methodology
- Weeks 9-12: Refine agents based on methodology fidelity testing
- Weeks 13-16: Cohort launch and real-world validation

## Red Flags to Watch For

🚩 **"We don't have time for materials analysis"**
→ You'll build agents that teach generic advice, not YOUR methodology

🚩 **"Let's just ask experts everything"**
→ You'll waste their time on things already documented

🚩 **"We'll document this later"**
→ You won't. Synthesize immediately or knowledge evaporates.

🚩 **"Methodology & Cohort Facilitator doesn't have 15-20 hrs/week"**
→ Adjust timeline or get help. This is foundational work.

🚩 **"AI Engineer can't wait for methodology"**
→ They can prototype architecture, but agent prompts need methodology

## Questions or Blockers?

**If materials are overwhelming:**
→ Start with just 2-3 facilitator guides. That's enough to begin.

**If experts aren't available for 3 weeks:**
→ Adjust timeline. Better to get quality time with them than rush.

**If Methodology & Cohort Facilitator doesn't have bandwidth:**
→ Talk to me about scaling back scope or phasing the work.

**If you're not sure where materials are:**
→ Start with what you know you have. Inventory expands as you go.

**If you're unsure about prioritization:**
→ Facilitator guides first, always. They're the skeleton of the methodology.

## Why This Matters (Reminder)

Without codifying the methodology:
- ❌ Agents will teach generic Lean Startup / Business Model Canvas (available anywhere)
- ❌ You'll lose the unique value of your expert partners
- ❌ Methodology optimized for underserved populations won't be captured
- ❌ Agents won't know when/how to adapt for your target demographic
- ❌ You'll essentially be building generic AI entrepreneurship assistants, not YOUR program

With the methodology codified:
- ✅ Agents teach YOUR specific approach
- ✅ Framework optimized for ≤150% poverty line participants
- ✅ Unique differentiation from generic programs
- ✅ Evidence-based approach (proven with real participants)
- ✅ Foundation for long-term program development and scaling

**This is foundational work. It's worth the time.**
