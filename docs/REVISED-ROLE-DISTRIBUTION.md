## Risks & Mitigations

### **Risk 1: PM Overloaded**
**Symptom:** PM working 30+ hrs/week, burning out
**Mitigation:**
- Deprioritize operations (delegate more to Methodology & Cohort Facilitator)
- Lean heavily on community partner for recruitment
- UI/UX/CX Product Advisor owns portal design (PM doesn't review every detail)
- Engineer takes full ownership of portal implementation (PM doesn't review every detail)

---

### **Risk 2: PM-Engineer Coordination Overhead**
**Symptom:** Lots of time spent coordinating, not building
**Mitigation:**
- Clear division of labor (above framework)
- Scheduled pairing sessions (2-3 hrs, 2x/week)
- Async communication for most updates
- PM owns prompts (in repo), Engineer owns code

---

### **Risk 3: Agent Quality Suffers**
**Symptom:** Agents don't teach methodology well
**Mitigation:**
- Methodology & Cohort Facilitator validates agent fidelity (weekly)
- Methodology experts spot-check agents (Phase 4)
- Rapid iteration based on testing feedback
- PM's role is specifically to ensure quality

---

### **Risk 4: Engineer Underutilized**
**Symptom:** Engineer waiting for PM on agent work
**Mitigation:**
- Engineer works on portal in parallel (full ownership)
- Clear backlog of agent tasks (Engineer can pull work)
- PM writes prompts ahead, Engineer implements
- Async workflow (not always paired)

---

✅ Direct control over agent quality (product vision)

### **For AI Engineer:**
✅ More ownership (portal, infrastructure, DevOps)
✅ Clear domain (technical implementation)
✅ Less ambiguity (PM handles methodology translation)
✅ Can focus on code quality and performance

### **For Methodology & Cohort Facilitator:**
✅ Owns methodology (authority and ownership)
✅ Clear role (curriculum, facilitation, validation)
✅ Not bottlenecked on PM (more autonomy)
✅ Focused expertise (learning design, not tech)
