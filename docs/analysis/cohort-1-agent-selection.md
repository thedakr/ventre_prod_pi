## Tier 1 Analysis: STRONG CANDIDATES (Choose 1-3)

### 🟢 4. Business & Revenue Model
**Nickname:** "The Economic Engine Designer"

**Why strong fit:**
- **Universal relevance:** Every participant needs to figure out "how do I make money?"
- **Stage-agnostic:** Foundation (design model) → Launch (optimize economics)
- **Perfect for underserved:** Jobs-to-Be-Done pricing framework teaches value-based pricing (vs. cost-plus)
- **Practical:** Unit economics, pricing strategy, business model canvas

**Participant coverage:**
- ✅ Small business (63%): Pricing, business model, unit economics
- ✅ Tech startup (30%): SaaS metrics, revenue models
- ✅ Social cause (29%): Sustainable monetization, impact + profit

**AI Impact:** HIGH (financial modeling, scenario analysis, JTBD framework application)

**Concerns:** None - this is universally needed

**Recommendation:** **STRONG YES** - Should be agent #4

---

### 🟢 5. Route-to-Market & GTM
**Nickname:** "The Market Access Strategist"

**Why strong fit:**
- **Universal question:** "How do I get customers?" (all participants ask this)
- **Small business critical:** Retail, service, local businesses need practical customer acquisition

- ✅ Social cause (29%): Community outreach, mission-driven marketing

**AI Impact:** HIGH (channel optimization, CAC modeling, funnel analysis)

**Concerns:** Could overlap with Market Discovery (customer research vs. customer acquisition)

**Recommendation:** **STRONG YES** - Should be agent #5

---

### 🟡 6. Strategic Conviction Keeper
**Nickname:** "The Compass"

**Why moderate fit:**
- **Helps with pivot/persevere:** Critical during intense 4-week cohort
- **Stage-agnostic:** Useful across all stages
- **Prevents common mistake:** Premature giving up OR stubborn persistence
- **Supports cohort dynamic:** Manages pressure of group sessions and peer comparison

**Participant coverage:**
- ✅ All participants face "should I pivot?" questions
- ✅ Intense 4-week format increases doubt/pressure
- ✅ Peer dynamics can cause conviction drift

**AI Impact:** MEDIUM (tracking patterns, detecting drift) - but strategic conviction deeply human

**Concerns:**
- May be covered by Chief of Staff + Methodology Coach
- Less urgent in 4-week cohort than 6-month program
- Medium AI impact (more human judgment needed)

**Recommendation:** **MAYBE** - Agent #6 if we want 6 total, **SKIP** if we want 5

---

### 🔴 Capital & Financing (CFO)
**Nickname:** "The CFO"

**Why weak fit for Cohort 1:**
- **Limited relevance:** Most participants bootstrapping or low-capital needs
- **Stage mismatch:** Fundraising typically later stage (Development/Launch)
- **Underserved context:** Participants unlikely to raise VC (not the demographic)
- **Overlap risk:** Business/Revenue Model agent covers unit economics and basic financial modeling

**Participant coverage:**
- ⚠️ Small business (63%): May need basic budgeting, but not fundraising
- ✅ Tech startup (30%): Some may need fundraising guidance
- ⚠️ Social cause (29%): May need grant/impact funding (not VC)

**AI Impact:** HIGH (financial modeling, burn tracking) - but feature not needed yet

**Recommendation:** **DEFER to Cohort 2** - Build when participants have traction and fundraising needs

---

### 🔴 Product & Technology (The Builder)
**Nickname:** "The Builder"

**Why weak fit for Cohort 1:**
- **Limited relevance:** Only serves 30% tech startup participants
- **Too software-focused:** Code generation, technical architecture, MVP scoping
- **Wrong audience:** 63% small business (retail, service, local) don't need this
- **Stage mismatch:** Coding/building should come AFTER validation (which most haven't done)

**Participant coverage:**
- ❌ Small business (63%): Not building software products
- ✅ Tech startup (30%): Highly relevant for this subset
- ❌ Social cause (29%): Most not tech-focused

**AI Impact:** HIGH (code generation, architecture) - but wrong audience

**Recommendation:** **DEFER to Cohort 2+** - Build when you have tech-heavy cohorts, or offer as optional specialist

---

### 🔴 Vision & Alignment
**Nickname:** "The North Star Keeper"

**Why weak fit for Cohort 1:**
- **Time horizon mismatch:** Vision/values work more relevant for later stages
- **Overlap:** Chief of Staff + Methodology Coach can cover basic vision alignment
- **Not urgent:** In 4 weeks, action > deep vision work
- **Medium AI impact:** This is deeply human work (60% automation)

**Recommendation:** **DEFER to Cohort 2** - Important but not urgent for 4-week MVP

---

### 🔴 Founder & Team Readiness
**Nickname:** "The Foundation Builder"

**Why weak fit for Cohort 1:**
- **Most participants solo:** Early stage, not hiring/team-building yet
- **Time horizon:** Team dynamics, equity splits, hiring more relevant 6+ months in
- **Stage mismatch:** Foundation phase (where most are) is solo validation work

**Recommendation:** **DEFER to Cohort 2** - Build when participants are hiring

---

## Cohort Facilitator Agent (Tier 2)

### ✅ Cohort Facilitator Agent
**Scope:** Knows ALL participants' projects, facilitates group dynamics

**Why essential:**
- **Two-tier architecture requirement:** Tier 1 (individual) + Tier 2 (cohort)
- **Session prep:** Helps human facilitators prepare for 8 group sessions
- **Synthesis:** "Sarah is stuck on pricing, Jake just validated his customer segment, Maria needs help with GTM - here's how to structure today's discussion"
- **Cross-participant connections:** Identifies peer learning opportunities
- **Artifact aggregation:** Synthesizes weekly management reports across cohort

**AI Impact:** HIGH (synthesis, pattern recognition across participants)

**Decision:** **BUILD for Cohort 1** - Critical for human facilitator support

---

## What We're NOT Building (Yet)

**Defer to Cohort 2+:**
- Vision & Alignment (#01) - Important but not urgent for 4 weeks
- Business Archetype (#02) - Overlaps with Business/Revenue Model
- Founder & Team Readiness (#03) - Most participants solo/early
- Market Positioning (#06) - Can be covered by Market Discovery + Revenue Model
- Brand & Storytelling (#07) - Not urgent for 4-week validation cohort
- Ecosystem & Competitive (#08) - Can be covered by Market Discovery
- Legal, Risk & Compliance (#09) - Premature for most participants
- Product & Technology (#10) - Only serves 30% tech, wrong audience
- People, Culture & Leadership (#12) - Team-building, premature
- Capital & Financing (#13) - Fundraising premature for most
- Operations & Systems (#14) - Process optimization, not urgent yet
- Customer Success & Retention (#15) - Need customers first
- Growth & Scaling (#16) - Premature (need PMF first)
- Innovation & Learning (#17) - Later stage strategic adaptation
- Founder Longevity (#18) - Important but longer-term
- Impact & Sustainability (#19) - Can be addressed within other agents
- Exit & Legacy (#20) - Way premature
- Cognitive Loop Support (#22) - Can be integrated into Chief of Staff

- Cross-Domain Integration (#24) - Can be integrated into Chief of Staff

**Rationale:** Focus MVP on highest-impact agents that serve all participants. Build additional agents based on Cohort 1 learnings.

## Next Steps

1. **Get user confirmation:** 5 agents (recommended) or 6 agents?
2. **Update Executive Summary** with final agent lineup
3. **Design agent prompts** for selected 5-6 agents
4. **Build two-tier architecture** (Tier 1 individual + Tier 2 cohort)
5. **Validate with Methodology & Cohort Facilitator** (expert review)

**Last Updated:** 2025-11-05
**Status:** Awaiting PM/PI decision on 5 vs 6 agents
