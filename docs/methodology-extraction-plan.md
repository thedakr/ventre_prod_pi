# Methodology Extraction & Synthesis Plan

**Purpose:** Distill the entrepreneurship "mastery" framework from materials and expert minds to create the foundation for AI agent implementation.

**Date:** 2025-11-03
**Status:** Draft for Execution

---

## Why This Matters

**Critical Insight:** You can't implement effective AI agents without first codifying the methodology they'll teach and guide.

**The Gap:**
- You have agent specifications (what agents should DO)
- You have materials and expert access (where knowledge lives)
- You need the methodology framework (what agents should TEACH/GUIDE)

**Without this:**
- Agents will default to generic startup frameworks (Lean Startup, BMC, etc.)
- You'll lose the unique value of your methodology partners' approach
- The methodology specifically suited for underserved populations won't be captured
- Agents won't know when/how to adapt for your target demographic

**With this:**
- Agents teach YOUR specific methodology
- Framework is optimized for 150% poverty line and below
- Unique differentiation from generic programs
- Evidence-based approach (proven with real engagements)

---

## Three Core Hypotheses to Validate/Support

As you extract the methodology, keep these hypotheses in mind:

### Hypothesis 1: Latent Entrepreneurs Exist in Poor Populations
**What to look for in materials/experts:**
- Evidence of participants who discovered entrepreneurial capacity
- Barriers that prevented them from starting before
- What unlocked their entrepreneurial potential
- Characteristics of "latent" vs. "active" entrepreneurs

**Questions for experts:**
- What patterns do you see in participants who surprise themselves?
- What prevents latent entrepreneurs from self-identifying?
- How do you surface entrepreneurial capability in someone who doesn't see it?

---

### Hypothesis 2: This Methodology is Uniquely Suited for Underserved Populations
**What to look for in materials/experts:**
- Specific adaptations for low-resource contexts
- How methodology differs from traditional entrepreneurship programs
- What makes it accessible to low education/low capital participants
- Success patterns with underserved vs. resourced participants

**Questions for experts:**
- What would you do differently if teaching Harvard MBAs vs. poverty-line participants?
- What are the unique needs of underserved entrepreneurs?
- Where do traditional programs fail this demographic?
- What innovations did you develop specifically for accessibility?

---

### Hypothesis 3: AI Can Transform Entrepreneurship Practice for This Population
**What to look for in materials/experts:**
- Where participants get stuck (AI could help)
- What expert guidance is most valuable (AI could replicate)
- What's time-consuming for facilitators (AI could scale)
- Where participants need 24/7 support (AI enables)

**Questions for experts:**
- Where do participants most need help between sessions?
- What questions get asked repeatedly?
- What expertise do participants lack access to?
- If you could clone yourself, where would you deploy your clones?

---

---

## Phase 2: Expert Knowledge Extraction

**Challenge:** Experts often don't realize what they know (tacit knowledge). You need structured techniques to extract the implicit wisdom.

### Step 2.1: Prepare for Expert Engagement (Week 1)

**Before you meet with experts, you need:**

1. **Materials analysis complete** (or at least high-priority items)
   - So you can ask targeted questions
   - So you can validate what you found
   - So you don't waste their time asking what's already documented

2. **Hypothesis list** (what you think you understand)
   - "We believe your methodology emphasizes X. Is that right?"
   - This helps experts correct misconceptions quickly

3. **Gap list** (what you don't understand)
   - "We couldn't figure out when you do X vs. Y. How do you decide?"
   - This focuses conversation on high-value knowledge

4. **Use cases** (scenarios to walk through)
   - "Walk us through how you'd handle a participant who..."
   - This reveals decision-making processes

**Preparation Deliverable:** Expert engagement brief
```markdown

Use plain language, avoid 'market sizing' jargon.
Break into 3 simple questions: Who has the problem? How bad is it?
What do they do today?"

Agent System Prompt Includes:
"When a participant is exploring their business idea, guide them through
problem validation using these 3 questions:
1. Who specifically has this problem? Help them get concrete.
2. How much does this problem bother them? Look for evidence.
3. What are they doing today to deal with it? This reveals if it's real.

Use simple language. Don't say 'market sizing' or 'TAM/SAM/SOM'.
Say 'Who would buy this?' instead.

If they get stuck, offer examples: [from methodology materials]..."

- **Why:** Strategic oversight, expert relationship management
- **Time:** 10-20% of time for Weeks 1-4 (4-8 hours/week)
- **Responsibilities:**
  - Schedule and manage expert relationships
  - Attend expert sessions (observe, take notes)
  - Review methodology framework (strategic lens)
  - Connect methodology to agent specs (bridge to AI Engineer)
  - Ensure timeline and priorities stay on track

### AI Engineer (RECEIVING ROLE → IMPLEMENTING ROLE)
- **Why:** Needs to understand methodology to implement agents
- **Time:**
  - Weeks 1-2: 5% (receive provisional synthesis)
  - Weeks 3-4: 20% (implement methodology in agents)
  - Weeks 5-6: 30% (refine based on fidelity testing)
- **Responsibilities:**
  - Review methodology synthesis (understand what agents need to teach)
  - Translate implementation specs into agent prompts
  - Iterate agent prompts based on methodology fidelity feedback
  - Technical implementation of methodology frameworks

### Methodology Experts (KNOWLEDGE SOURCE)
- **Time:** ~5-6 hours total (3-4 sessions @ 90 min each)
- **Role:**
  - Share tacit knowledge in structured sessions
  - Validate methodology framework
  - Spot-check agent conversations for fidelity

## Tips for Effective Knowledge Extraction

### 1. Record Everything (With Permission)
- Audio/video recording of expert sessions
- Transcribe for detailed analysis
- Easier to focus on conversation if you're not frantically note-taking

### 2. Ask "Why" and "How" Not Just "What"
- "What do you teach?" → Documents can show this
- "Why do you teach X before Y?" → Reveals underlying logic
- "How do you explain X to someone who's confused?" → Reveals tacit skill

### 3. Use Scenarios and Examples
- "Walk me through how you'd handle [scenario]..."
- Concrete examples reveal decision-making processes
- Experts often can't articulate principles abstractly but can show through cases

### 4. Look for Contradictions
- Between materials and experts ("Materials say X, but you just said Y...")
- Contradictions reveal evolution of thinking or context-specific adaptations

### 5. Synthesize Quickly
- Write up insights within 24 hours of sessions
- Memory fades fast, patterns are clearer when fresh

### 6. Validate Early and Often
- Don't wait till end to check understanding
- "Did I get that right?" after each session
- Show drafts early, iterate based on feedback

### 7. Focus on the Unique
- Generic startup advice is everywhere (Lean Startup, BMC, etc.)
- Dig for what makes THIS methodology different
- Especially: adaptations for underserved populations

## Questions for You

To help me refine this plan, I need to know:

### About Materials:
1. **How much material exists?** (Rough estimate: 5 documents? 50 documents? 500?)
2. **What format?** (PDFs, slides, videos, workbooks, recordings?)
3. **Where are they?** (Shared drive? Physical files? Mixed?)
4. **Have you reviewed them?** (Do you have a sense of what's there?)

### About Experts:
1. **How available are they?** (Can they do 3-4 x 90-min sessions over next 3 weeks?)
2. **How comfortable are they with being "mined" for knowledge?** (Enthusiastic? Hesitant?)
3. **Are they both needed in sessions or can you split?** (2 experts = 2x the time OR divide and conquer?)
4. **Do they facilitate together or separately?** (Joint wisdom or individual approaches?)

### About Timeline:
1. **Is Week 1-4 realistic for methodology extraction?** (Given your other priorities?)
2. **Can Education Specialist dedicate 15-20 hrs/week to this?** (Or do we need to scale back?)
3. **Do you need methodology locked before agent development starts?** (Or can they proceed in parallel?)

### About Scope:
1. **Full methodology or MVP methodology?** (Should we extract EVERYTHING or focus on Foundation phase only for pilot?)
2. **All 26 agents or just MVP 3 agents?** (Implementation specs for 3 vs. 26 is very different scope)

## Next Immediate Action

**THIS WEEK:**
1. **Do materials inventory** (4-6 hours) - You + Education Specialist
2. **Schedule Expert Session 1** (30 min) - You
3. **Begin analyzing top 3 materials** (6-8 hours) - Education Specialist

**Want me to create:**
- Materials inventory template (spreadsheet)?
- Extraction template (with examples)?
- Expert session agendas (with specific questions)?
- Something else?
