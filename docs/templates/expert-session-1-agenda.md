### Part 3: Materials Validation (30 min)

**Our Goals:**
- Validate what we learned from materials
- Correct misconceptions
- Fill gaps

**Our Approach:**
"We've analyzed [X materials] so far. Let us share what we think we learned, and you tell us what we got right, what we got wrong, and what we missed."

**Present:**
- Show them our provisional methodology synthesis (2-3 pages)
- Walk through key frameworks we identified
- Walk through principles we extracted
- Walk through the structure/sequence we think we see

**Questions:**
1. "Does this feel like an accurate representation of your methodology?"
2. "What did we get wrong or misunderstand?"
3. "What's missing that's really important?"
4. "What surprised you in what we found?"
5. "Are there materials we haven't seen yet that would really help us understand?"

**Specific Deep-Dives** (based on your materials analysis):
- [Specific framework or concept that was unclear]
- [Apparent contradiction between materials]
- [Gap where we couldn't figure something out]

**Notes Section:**
[Corrections, additions, clarifications]

### Part 4: Underserved Population Focus (15 min)

**Our Goals:**
- Understand adaptations for poverty-line participants
- Learn what makes methodology suited for this demographic

**Questions:**

1. **Target Demographic:**
   - "Our target is people at or below 150% of federal poverty line. What specific challenges do they face?"
   - "How have you adapted your methodology for low-resource participants?"
   - "What would you do differently teaching this to Harvard MBAs vs. participants in poverty?"

2. **Barriers & Solutions:**
   - "What barriers prevent low-income people from entrepreneurship?"
   - "How does your methodology address these barriers specifically?"
   - "What language or framing do you use differently for this audience?"

3. **Success with Underserved:**
