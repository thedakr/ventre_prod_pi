# Materials Triage Framework

**Purpose:** Categorize 500+ materials into tiers for efficient extraction
**Time Required:** 4-8 hours
**Owner:** Methodology & Cohort Facilitator (lead) + PM (support)

---

## Philosophy: 80/20 Rule

With 500+ documents, analyzing everything is:
- ❌ Unrealistic (would take 1,250+ hours at 2.5 hrs/doc)
- ❌ Unnecessary (most value in ~20% of materials)
- ❌ Inefficient (diminishing returns)

Instead:
- ✅ **Tier 1 (20-30 docs):** Deep analysis - Extract everything
- ✅ **Tier 2 (50-100 docs):** Selective analysis - Sample for patterns
- ✅ **Tier 3 (400+ docs):** Reference only - Consult if needed

**Goal:** 80% of methodology value from 20% of materials

---

### Tier 2: SELECTIVE ANALYSIS (Reference)

**Characteristics:**
- Supplementary materials
- Variations on themes
- Additional examples

**Tier 2 Materials (50-100 total):**

**Category A: Additional Facilitator Resources**
- Specialized session guides
- Advanced facilitation techniques
- Edge case handling
- **Approach:** Sample 3-5 to understand patterns

- Different facilitators/contexts
- **Approach:** Watch 10-15 min highlights, full view if unique

**Category D: Participant Feedback**
- Surveys and evaluations

- **Approach:** Skim abstracts, read if directly relevant

---

### Tier 3: REFERENCE ONLY (Archive)

**Characteristics:**

**Category C: Supporting Readings**
- Recommended articles
- Background reading lists
- Suggested resources
- Book excerpts

**Category D: Miscellaneous**
- Meeting notes
- Internal discussions
- Draft versions of finalized docs
- Archived/outdated materials

---

## Triage Process (4-8 Hours)

### Step 1: Quick Scan (2-3 hours)

**Action:** Go through materials collection quickly
- Don't read in detail
- Look at titles, file types, dates
- Skim first page/table of contents
- Get sense of what exists

**Goal:** Rough categorization

---

### Step 2: Categorize (1-2 hours)

**Create three lists:**

**Tier 1 Candidates:**
- Facilitator guides ✓
- Methodology docs ✓
- Primary workbooks ✓
- Best case studies ✓
- Core recordings ✓

**Tier 2 Candidates:**
- Supplementary exercises
- Additional recordings
- Participant feedback collections
- Supporting research

**Tier 3 (Everything Else):**
- Admin materials
- Marketing content
- Supporting readings
- Miscellaneous

---

### Step 3: Refine Tier 1 (1-2 hours)

**Narrow to 20-30 documents:**

**Questions to ask:**
- Is this a primary or supplementary resource?
- Does this represent core methodology or variation?
- Would analyzing this reveal something unique?
- Is this a duplicate/similar to another doc?
- Do experts reference this frequently?

**Goal:** Prioritized list of 20-30 Tier 1 documents

---

### Step 4: Prioritize Tier 1 (30 min - 1 hour)

**Put Tier 1 in analysis order:**

**First 3 (Cornerstone):**
1. Primary facilitator guide (or best overview doc)
2. Methodology framework/principles doc
3. Best case study

**Next 5-10:**
- Key participant exercises
- Core session recordings
- Additional facilitator guides
- Methodology deep-dives

**Remaining 12-20:**
- Additional case studies
- Supplementary materials
- Variations and examples

**Cornerstone Analysis (3 docs):**
- Estimated: 2.5 hrs per doc = 7.5 hours total
- Will establish actual velocity

**Remaining Tier 1 (17-27 docs):**
- At 2.5 hrs per doc: 42-67 hours
- At Methodology & Cohort Facilitator capacity (__hrs/week): __-__ weeks

**Total Phase 2 Projection:**
- Best case: __ weeks
- Likely case: __ weeks
- Conservative: __ weeks

*Will update after cornerstone analysis establishes real velocity*

## Decision Rules for Edge Cases

### "Should this be Tier 1 or Tier 2?"

**Tier 1 if:**
- ✅ Experts explicitly say "This is essential"
- ✅ It's the primary/official version (not a variant)
- ✅ It contains unique frameworks not in other materials
- ✅ It represents core methodology (not application)
- ✅ You can't understand methodology without it

**Tier 2 if:**
- ✅ It's one of many similar examples
- ✅ It's a variation on a theme
- ✅ It's supplementary to a core resource
- ✅ It provides supporting evidence (not core teaching)

**When in doubt:** Start Tier 2, promote to Tier 1 if analysis reveals it's essential

---

### "Should this be Tier 2 or Tier 3?"

**Tier 2 if:**
- ✅ It might contain unique insights
- ✅ Experts reference it occasionally
- ✅ It's participant-facing or facilitator-facing
- ✅ It relates directly to methodology teaching/learning

**Tier 3 if:**
- ✅ It's purely administrative
- ✅ It's marketing/promotional
- ✅ It's tangentially related background
- ✅ It's a duplicate or draft of something else

**When in doubt:** Tier 2 (easier to skip during analysis than to hunt for it later)

---

## Tips for Efficient Triage

### Do:
- ✅ Start with folder/file structure (often pre-organized)
- ✅ Look for "core," "primary," "main," "guide" in titles
- ✅ Check file dates (newer often more refined)
- ✅ Ask experts "What are the 5 most important docs?"
- ✅ Trust your gut (experienced educators recognize core materials)

### Don't:
- ❌ Read every document in detail during triage
- ❌ Try to analyze while triaging (two separate tasks)
- ❌ Stress about perfect categorization (iterate as you learn)
- ❌ Put everything in Tier 1 "just in case"
- ❌ Spend more than 8 hours on triage (diminishing returns)

---

## Validation Checkpoint

**Before moving to analysis, confirm:**

- [ ] Tier 1 contains 20-30 documents (not 50, not 5)
- [ ] Tier 1 includes facilitator guides and methodology docs
- [ ] Tier 1 is prioritized (know what to analyze first)
- [ ] Tier 2 and 3 are cataloged (know what's available)
- [ ] Velocity projection is realistic given team capacity
- [ ] Team agrees this is the right approach

**If any checkbox is unchecked, revise triage before proceeding.**

---

## After Triage: Next Steps

1. **Share Tier 1 list** with experts (for validation)
   - "We identified these 25 docs as highest priority. Did we miss anything critical?"

2. **Begin cornerstone analysis** (3 docs)
   - Use `docs/templates/material-extraction.md`
   - Time yourself to establish velocity

3. **Update velocity projection** after cornerstone
   - Adjust Phase 2 timeline based on real data

4. **Continue Tier 1 analysis** in priority order
   - Track velocity every 3-5 docs
   - Adjust projections as you go

---

## Common Triage Scenarios

### Scenario 1: "Everything looks important!"
**Response:** It's not. Apply 80/20 rule ruthlessly. Pick top 25 most essential.

### Scenario 2: "I found 10 facilitator guides - which one?"
**Response:** Newest, most comprehensive, or the one experts use most. Analyze 1-2, reference others.

### Scenario 3: "Materials are poorly organized"
**Response:** That's okay. Your triage creates the organization. Patterns will emerge.

### Scenario 4: "I'm not sure what's in each doc without reading it"
**Response:** Skim first page and ToC. That's enough to categorize. Deep reading comes during analysis.

### Scenario 5: "Experts say 'it's all important'"
**Response:** Ask: "If you could only save 20 docs in a fire, which ones?" That's Tier 1.

---

## Success Criteria

**Good triage achieves:**
- ✅ Clear path forward (know what to analyze first)
- ✅ Realistic scope (20-30 Tier 1, not 100)
- ✅ Team alignment (everyone agrees on priorities)
- ✅ Velocity projection (can estimate Phase 2 duration)
- ✅ Reference catalog (know what's available if needed)

**Time well spent:** 4-8 hours of triage saves 100+ hours of misdirected analysis.
